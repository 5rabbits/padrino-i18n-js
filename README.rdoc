= i18n-js wrapper for Padrino

Read https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js for how to use i18n-js on your app but include the gem i18n-js_padrino instead of the original in your Gemfile.

== Make it work in dev mode (quick & dirty way)

Include this in your app.rb:

  before do
    FiveRabbits::I18n.export! if (Padrino.env == :development)
  end
